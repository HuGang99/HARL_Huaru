<h1 align="center"> Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning </h1>

This repository contains the **official implementation** of **Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL)** algorithms, including **HAPPO**, **HATRPO**, **HAA2C**, **HADDPG**, **HATD3**, **HAD3QN**, and **HASAC**, based on PyTorch. ***HARL algorithms are markedly different from MAPPO in that they are generally applicable to heterogeneous agents and are supported by rigorous theories, often achieving superior performance.*** This repository allows researchers and practitioners to easily reproduce our results on seven challenging benchmarks or apply HARL algorithms to their intended applications.



## Overview

HARL algorithms are our novel solutions to achieving effective multi-agent cooperation in the general *heterogeneous-agent* settings, without relying on the restrictive *parameter-sharing* trick. 

### Key features

- HARL algorithms achieve coordinated agent updates by employing the *sequential update scheme*, different from the *simultaneous update scheme* utilized by MAPPO and MADDPG.
- HARL algorithms enjoy theoretical guarantees of **monotonic improvement** and **convergence to equilibrium**, ensuring their efficacy in promoting cooperative behavior among agents.
- Both on-policy and off-policy HARL algorithms, exemplified by **HAPPO** and **HASAC** respectively, demonstrate superior performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

The following figure is an illustration of the *sequential update scheme*

For more details, please refer to our [HARL](https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0488.html) (JMLR 2024) and [MEHARL](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tmqOhBC4a5) (ICLR 2024 spotlight) papers.


## Installation

### Install HARL

```shell
conda create -n harl python=3.8
conda activate harl
# Install pytorch>=1.9.0 (CUDA>=11.0) manually
git clone https://github.com/PKU-MARL/HARL.git
cd HARL
pip install -e .
```



### Install Environments Dependencies

Along with HARL algorithms, we also implement the interfaces for seven common environments ([SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac), [SMACv2](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smacv2), [MAMuJoCo](https://github.com/schroederdewitt/multiagent_mujoco), [MPE](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/mpe/), [Google Research Football](https://github.com/google-research/football), [Bi-DexterousHands](https://github.com/PKU-MARL/DexterousHands), [Light Aircraft Game](https://github.com/liuqh16/CloseAirCombat)) and they can be used directly. (We also implement the interface for [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/). Gym is a single-agent environment, which can be seen as a special case of multi-agent environments. It is included mainly for reference purposes.) You may choose to install the dependencies to the environments you want to use.

**Install Dependencies of Bi-DexterousHands**

Bi-DexterousHands depend on IsaacGym. The hardware requirements of IsaacGym has to be satisfied. To install IsaacGym, download IsaacGym Preview 4 release from [its official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym/download). Then run `pip install -e .` under its `python` folder.

**Install Light Aircraft Game**

[Light Aircraft Game](https://github.com/liuqh16/CloseAirCombat) (LAG) is a recently developed cooperative-competitive environment for red and blue aircraft games, offering various settings such as single control, 1v1, and 2v2 scenarios. In the context of multi-agent scenarios, LAG currently supports self-play only for 2v2 settings. To address this limitation, we introduce novel cooperative non-weapon and shoot-missile tasks where two agents collaborate to combat two opponents controlled by the built-in AI. In the non-weapon task, agents are trained to fly towards the opponents' tails while maintaining a suitable distance. In the shoot-missile task, agents learn to dodge opponent missiles and launch their own missiles to destroy the opponents.

To install LAG, run the following command:
```shell
# Install dependencies
pip install torch pymap3d jsbsim==1.1.6 geographiclib gym==0.21.0 wandb icecream setproctitle
# Initialize submodules(*JSBSim-Team/jsbsim*)
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Usage

### Training on Existing Environments

To train an algorithm on a provided environment, users can modify yaml configuration files of the corresponding algorithm and environment under `harl/configs/algos_cfgs` and `harl/configs/envs_cfgs` as they wish, go to `examples` folder, and then start training with a one-liner `python train.py --algo <ALGO> --env <ENV> --exp_name <EXPERIMENT NAME>` or `python train.py --load_config <CONFIG FILE PATH> --exp_name <EXPERIMENT NAME>`, where the latter is mostly used when reproducing an experiment. We provide the **tuned configurations** for algorithms in each environments under `tuned_configs` folder. Users can **reproduce our results** by using `python train.py --load_config <TUNED CONFIG PATH> --exp_name <EXPERIMENT NAME>` and change `<TUNED CONFIG PATH>` to the absolute path of the tuned config file on their machine.

During training, users receive continuous logging feedback in the terminal.

After training, users can check the log file, tensorboard output, experiment configuration, and saved models under the generated `results` folder. Moreover, users can also render the trained models by setting `use_render: True`, `model_dir: <path to trained models>` in algorithm configuration file (for football users also need to set `render: True` in the environment configuration file), and use the same training command as above again. For SMAC and SMACv2, rendering comes in the form of video replay automatically saved to the `StarCraftII/Replays` folder (more details can be found [here](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac#saving-and-watching-starcraft-ii-replays)).

To enable batch running, we allow users to modify yaml configs in the command line. For each training command, users specify the special parameters in the commands with the same names as in the config files. For example, if you want to run HAPPO on SMAC tasks under three random seeds. You can customize the configs and replace `train.sh` with the following commands:

```shell
for seed in $(seq 1 3)
do
	python train.py --algo happo --env smac --exp_name test --seed $seed
done
```



### Applying to New Environments

If you want to apply HA series algorithms to solve new tasks, you need to implement environment interfaces, following the examples of the seven environments provided. A simplest interface may look like:

```python
class Env:
    def __init__(self, args):
        self.env = ...
        self.n_agents = ...
        self.share_observation_space = ...
        self.observation_space = ...
        self.action_space = ...

    def step(self, actions):
        return obs, state, rewards, dones, info, available_actions

    def reset(self):
        return obs, state, available_actions

    def seed(self, seed):
        pass

    def render(self):
        pass

    def close(self):
        self.env.close()
```

The purpose of interface is to *hide environment-specific details and expose a unified interaction protocol, so that other modules could process data uniformly*.

You may also want to produce continuous logging output during training. If you intend to use an on-policy algorithm, you need to implement a logger for your environment. The simplest logger can inherit from `BaseLogger` in `harl/common/base_logger.py` and implement the `get_task_name` function. More customised logging requirements can be fulfilled by extending or overriding more functions. We recommend referring to the existing loggers in each environment directory to get to know how it is written. If an off-policy algorithm is used, you can directly customise logging by modifying the off-policy runner code. In the end, please register the logger (if any), add a yaml config file, and add necessary code to `examples/train.py`, `harl/utils/configs_tool.py`, and `harl/utils/envs_tool.py`. Again, following the existing seven environment examples will be convenient.

After these steps, you can apply the algorithms immediately as above.
